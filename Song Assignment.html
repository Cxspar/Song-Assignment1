    <h3>Verse 1</h3>
<!--beginning of song-->
    <p> Slip back out of whack at your best <br> <!--adding line breaks for the user to signify the end of a line-->
        It's a nightmare <br>
        So I'm joining the army<br>
        No house phones, but can I still call?<br>
        Will you wait for me now?<br>
        We've got the right to live, fight to use it<br>
        Got everything but you can just choose it<br>
        I won't just be a puppet on a string</p>

    <h3> Pre-Chorus</h3>
    <p> Don't go that way <br>
        I'll wait for you</p>

    <h3> Chorus 1</h3>

    <p> And I'm tired of all your friends<br>
        Listening at your door<br>
        I want what's better for you<br>
        So long, my friend and adversary<br>
        But I'll wait for you<br>
        </p>

    <h3> Verse 2</h3>

    <p> Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest<br>
        Are you okay?<br>
        I've been all around this town<br>
        Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years</p>

    <h3> Pre-Chorus</h3>
    <p> I'll wait for you<br>
        Will you wait for me too?</p>

    <h3> Chorus 2</h3>

    <p> And they sacrifice their lives<br>
        And they lied about those odds<br>
        They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again<br>
        So long, my adversary and friend</p>

    <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>

    <p> Don't go that way<br>
        I'll wait for you</p>

    <h3> Chorus 3</h3>

    <p> I'm tired of all your friends<br>
        Banging down your door<br>
        Get up in the morning yelling, "No more!"<br>
        So long, my friend and adversary<br>
        But I'll be waiting for you</p>

        <h2>About The Song</h2>
        <p>
            "Under Cover of Darkness" is the single served as the lead single for their fourth studio album, angles, and was released online on February 9, 2011.
            The song symbolizes war, and more specifically how the band was basically at war with each other due to stressful tour schedules, creativity, and clashing emotions.
            The album "Angles" was the first Strokes album to be written by all five band members.
